Problems are initially subdivided by the category they're in, and then into folders in the format ***####-l***, where ***####*** is the problem number and ***l*** its level.

Inside each folder there exists at least one source code file *(usually named **main**)* which holds the solution. The first two lines of said file are comments, the first being a link to the problem and the second the date in which it was solved.
