## [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset)

Problems are initially separated into the range they are in, according to their ID, and subsequently into folders in the format ***####-d***, where ***####*** is the problem ID *(0 padded)* and ***d*** its difficulty.

Inside of each problem folder there exists at least one file named ***solution*** which holds the source code. The first two lines of said file are comments, the first being a link to the problem and the second the date in which it was solved.

Due to the nature of the platform, the solutions present herein are not always directly compilable/executable, however pasting them into its code editor and running from there should work.
