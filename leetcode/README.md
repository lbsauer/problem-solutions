## [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset)

Problems are separated into folders in the format ***####-d***, where ***####*** is the problem number *(0 padded)* and ***d*** its difficulty.

Inside each folder there exists at least one file named ***solution*** which holds the source code. The first two lines of said file are comments, the first being a link to the problem and the second the date in which it was solved.

Due to the nature of the platform, the code therein present is not always directly compilable, however pasting it into their code editor and running from there should work.
